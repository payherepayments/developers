## The easiest way to start accepting payments

The easiest way to use Payhere is simply to copy the URL to your payment form and share it directly with your customers. That could be in an email, whats app message or by adding a link to your website. You can copy the link from the merchants admin when viewing your plans.

Once you have this setup you can start receiving payments, and even [use our webhooks](webhooks.md) to integrate further with your own system or website.

For more seamless integrations see our [Embed SDK](embed-sdk.md).
