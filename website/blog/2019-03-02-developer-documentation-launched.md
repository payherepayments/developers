Our big launch has had many of you signup and start using Payhere in really cool ways! This is something we should have done ages ago, but we're finally getting around to releasing our developer documentation. This site is to serve as an example of how Payhere can be integrated and to give you fine folks all the technical info so you can integrate any which way you like.

We'll be updating this site frequently over the next few weeks as we release our Embed SDK v2, move our API from private beta to public beta and mostly as we implement all the great feedback you give us.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out and as always let us know if you have any questions or feedback. Intercom messenger on the [main site](https://payhere.co) is the best way to get in touch.

Thanks,
Pete and the Payhere team
