![Payhere + React](/img/react-header.png)

We love [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) at Payhere! We recently made a lot of powerful updates to our embed SDK and wanted to bring those natively to React.

That time has now arrived, we’ve just launched our [payhere-embed-sdk](https://github.com/payherepayments/payhere-embed-sdk) on npm and it has React support built-in. Head over to the [React docs to get started](/docs/react-sdk).

Integrating payhere into your own websites / web apps allows a much more seamless experience and in combination with a modern frontend stack like Gatsby you can have lightening fast payments setup in a matter of minutes.

### Now possible with Payhere + React

#### 1. Calculate the price on your end

In combination with our donations feature you can pass in a custom amount generated on your site, this opens us up to integrations like shopping carts, especially now that we can capture additional data through custom fields.

[Find out how](/docs/react-sdk#passing-in-a-custom-price)

#### 2. Capture additional data

Hidden custom fields allow passing extra data along with a payment that will make its way back to your servers in a webhook or through our API. This allows you to do things like embed a hidden user_id with the payment and match it up when the webhook comes in.

We can’t wait to see what you build with Payhere and React!

Thanks,<br />
Team Payhere
